Analysis on Crypto Currency using Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Overview

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers and want to understand what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. With Unsupervised Machine Learning, we will process the data, form clusters, reduce dimensions, reduce the principal components using PCA.

## Purpose

* **Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.**
* **Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.**
* **Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.**
* **Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.**
* **Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.**
